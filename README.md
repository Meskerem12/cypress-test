# Cypress Test Project

Hey there! 👋  
This is a Cypress-based testing project I created to automate some of my front-end test cases, especially for local HTML forms and basic UI interactions.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- 🧪 **E2E Tests** — Located under `cypress/e2e/`, where all Cypress tests live.
- 🧾 **Local HTML Files** — My test forms and pages are under the `html/` folder.
- 📁 **Reports** — A folder to keep test reports (optional, based on setup).

## 🔧 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
